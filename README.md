Linux for OpenFrame
====================

These are the scripts and overlays which I use to create debootstrapped operating systems for OpenFrame devices, notably the OpenFrame 1 (sold in the UK as the O2 Joggler) and OpenFrame 2.


of-builder.sh
--------------

So you want to automatically build images for OpenFrame devices on your server? This is the script for you.

### Build Environment

The OpenFrame devices are all 32-bit, so you're going to need a i386 environment.

Our solution is to create a 32-bit chroot on a 64-bit system. For Debian Bullseye it can be achieved like this:

```
sudo apt install debootstrap schroot
sudo nano /etc/schroot/chroot.d/i386.conf
```

Copy in:

```
[i386]
description=i386
type=directory
union-type=overlay
directory=/var/lib/schroot/chroots/i386
personality=linux32
groups=root,sudo
root-groups=root,sudo
```

Then install the base system with debootstrap:

```
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/schroot/chroots/i386
sudo debootstrap --arch=i386 bullseye /var/lib/schroot/chroots/i386 http://deb.debian.org/debian
```

Hop in to the chrooted environment like this:

```
sudo schroot -c source:i386
```

You can then complete the setup of your build environment.

```
rm /var/lib/dpkg/statoverride 
rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock
dpkg --configure -a
apt update && apt upgrade
apt install autoconf bc bison build-essential curl debhelper debootstrap dosfstools flex git libelf-dev libncurses5-dev libssl-dev lsb-release parted rsync wget 
```

The build server runs a command like this from its crontab:

```
1 1 * * * schroot -c i386 -u root -- bash -c "cd /home/debian/build ; /home/debian/openframe-linux/of-builder.sh 'debian' 'bookworm' 'http://deb.debian.org/debian' '6.1' '/home/debian/www' &> /home/debian/www/logs/bookworm-6.1_`date +'\%Y-\%m-\%d-\%H\%M'`.txt"
```


of-cnc.sh
----------

This script provides a handy method of copying everything back from a storage device for packaging up into a .tgz. That .tgz can then magically be used by __ofimgcreate.sh__ to generate a reasonably fresh image.


of-imgcreate.sh
----------------

This script does the hard work of creating an image file of a given size, creating  filesystem on it, mounting it, and then going on to fetch and install Ubuntu using debootstrap.

You will also need the overlay files provided in this repo and some working kernel image packages.


of-imgmnt.sh
-------------

Used to mount image files for minor tweaks, meaning we don't need to rebuild things every time. Now with variable partition support!


of-serverclean.sh
-----------------

Basic build server cleaning script. Give it directories to clean line-by-line in a text file and once server drive space drops below 5 GB it removes any directories (and obviously their contents) that are older than 12 months.


Overlays
---------

The overlay files provide modifications to the vanilla system to provide some necessary and some nice-to-have features, including automatically configured GRUB, network settings from the `/boot` volume (ideal for preconfiguring), sensible system defaults and minimal firmware files.

The Intel microcode you need is `06-1c-02` from [their repository](https://github.com/intel/Intel-Linux-Processor-Microcode-Data-Files/tree/main/intel-ucode), should you be bothered about applying that.
